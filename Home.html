                <ul><li>When I was a kid, I had an ambition to be an engine driver. Still that idea is in my mind, but not sharp as it was.
                Being a stage drama actor is another aspiration in my mind. I think I would be able to acheive that goal one day. I like big vehicles like trucks, buses. 
                Because of this desire, I would like to have trucks and buses. I would like to buy a Porsche Panemera car. Those are few interesting aspirations in my life.</li></ul>
